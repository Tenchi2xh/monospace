# Typography in ten minutes (A chapter)

> Premature optimization is the root of all evil. **Donald E. Knuth**

Use the `process_elements` method to 'process' the **elements**. See chapter [](#a-sub-section).

```python
for line in words:
    print("foo")
    new_line()
    last_line = wrapped[-1]

    for word in line:
        if current_length + len(word) > width:
            new_line()
            last_line = wrapped[-1]

        last_line.append(word)
        current_length += len(word)
```

## Foobar {subtitle="Baz?"}

*This a **bold** claim*, but I stand behind it: if you learn and follow these five typography rules, you will be a better typographer than nearly every writer—and even most graphic designers.

### A sub-section

All it takes is ten minutes: five minutes to read these rules once. Then five minutes to read them again.

## This is a sub-chapter {subtitle="It looks cool"}

Ready? Go.

1. The typographic quality of your document is determined largely by how the [](#body-text) looks. Why? Because there's more body text than anything else. So start every project by making the body text look good. Then worry about the rest.

    In turn, the appearance of the body text is determined primarily by these four typographic choices:

    - Lorem ipsum dolor sit *amet*
    - Latine dictum sit altum videtur:
        1. Latin's really cool
        2. Don't you think?
        3. I think so
    - Nihil agere delectat

2. [](#point-size) is the how big the font is. In print, the most comfortable range for body text is **10–12 point**, or **15-25 pixels**^[This is a footnote. Well, more like a side note]. Not every font appears equally large at a given point size, so be prepared to adjust as needed.

3. [](#line-spacing) is the vertical distance between lines. It should be **120–145%** of the point size. In word processors, use the "Exact" line-spacing option to achieve this. The default single-line option is too tight; the 1 1/2-line option is too loose. In CSS, use the `line-height` property (preferably with a unitless value, so 130% would become 1.3).

4. [](#line-length) is the horizontal width of the text block. Line length should be an average of **45–90 characters** per line (use your word-count function) or **2–3 lowercase alphabets**, like so:
    
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcddefghijklm

    In a printed document, this usually means [](#page-margins) larger than one inch (a [](#typewriter-habit)). On a web page, it usually means preventing the text from flowing to the edges of the browser window.

5. And finally^[Another side note. Exciting!], font choice. The fastest, easiest, and most visible improvement you can make to your typography is to ignore the fonts already loaded on your computer (known as [](#system-fonts)) and the [](#free-fonts) that inundate the internet. Instead, buy a professional font (like those found in [](#font-recommendations)). A professional font gives you the benefit of a professional designer's skills without having to hire one.

    If that's impossible, you can still make good typography with system fonts. But choose wisely. And never choose [](#times-new-roman) or [](#arial), as those fonts are favored only by the apathetic and sloppy. Not by typographers. Not by you.

## In conclusion {subtitle="Another sub-chapter"}

That's it. As you put these five rules to work, you'll notice your documents starting to look more like professionally published material.

If you're ready for a little more, try the [](#summary-of-key-rules).

If you're ready for a lot more, start at the [](#foreword) and keep reading.

## Vetito lino oculis {subtitle="(It's Latin nonsense)"}

Exarsit in vires novis, taurorum, communem utriusque ululatibus quercus leto
illiusque pectora primo. Auctor **pallor** plectro Narcissumque citra tibi inrita
aves templa. Illa rapinae Triones primo ibi Bacchus; hic
et quaeque. Cinyrae et mala soror
capellae fando.

- Illa non Iovi attonitamque belli pertimuitque nomine
- De curvique staret ovi facto intortos
- Grata resolutaque discordibus poterat solus vincant
- Non servaverat arvis haec domus fovi satiatur
- Animae et adfata populus clara nocturnos fluviumque

Desiderat aras *restituit* quae Dianae cursu;
obscuram me ossa turba quamquam quoque mea. Saevisque supervenit lactens
conplexa: pretium cruori; vides finiat.

1. Tot dixit exit nil
2. Caeneus sanae quantoque nobis
3. Me ramos
4. Sacra seduxit Amathunta Olympi tonitrus adhuc atria
5. Quem campus
